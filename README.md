# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch

This repository contains my implementations of machine learning algorithms, created to further develop my understanding of concepts I learned while studying Data Science at the University of Maryland.

I plan to implement the following models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Random Forest Regression
